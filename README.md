> Amazing components &amp; design language in Scala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ant-design-binding/ant-design-binding.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ant-design-binding/ant-design-binding)

## Project state
Currently under early development

## Document | Getting Started
[Please see the document here](https://ant-design-binding.org/).

## Bootstrap stages
This project will follow 3 bootstrap stages.

Among these stages we will focus to implements components from **version 3.12.x** of antd.
### Stage 1:
* This stage is aiming to implements 56 antd components in a look-alike fashion.
* In this stage we will use the css file from antd distribution as much as possible.
* Codebase may change rapidly with or without breaking changes.
* Versions in this stage will be 0.x.x, and becomes 1.0.0 when this stage finished.
### Stage 2:
* This stage is aiming to let adb components has most of or even exact the same features as antd ones.
* In this stage we will use the css file from antd distribution as much as possible.
* Codebase may change rapidly with some breaking changes.
* Versions in this stage will be 1.x.x, and becomes 2.0.0 when this stage finished.
### Stage 3:
* This stage is aiming to produce documents & boilerplates/templates(just like ANT DESIGN PRO)
* In this stage we will switch to using self-maintained .less files and compile them into css.
* Codebase will becomes stable with maybe a little breaking changes.
* Versions in this stage will be 2.x.x, and becomes 3.0.0 when this stage finished.
